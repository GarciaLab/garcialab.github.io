# `garcialab.berkeley.edu`

Welcome to the GitHub Repository for the Garcia Lab website!


## Directory Structure
This repository obviously has a lot of directories and files, but you don't have 
to touch most of them to add/remove content to the website. Below is a brief outline 
of what all the directories/subdirectories are and when/if you would need to 
edit their contents. 

### `_data`: Where most of the site content lives
The `_data` folder contains an array of `YAML` files which define the content of 
the website. 

* `index.yml`: This defines what the boxes are on the front page, where they link to, and what images they show. 
* `nav.yml` : This defines the navigation links shown on the top of every page 
of the website and where they link to. 
* `members.yml` : This defines all of the *current* members of the lab. The data in this file is what populates the "people" page of the website. **Edit this file to add/remove members from the lab.**
* `former_members.yml` : THis defines all of the former members of the lab, including all of the visitors.
