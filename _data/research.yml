     Up until recently, state-of-the-art examinations of snapshots of dead, fixed
     embryos provided only glimpses of the dynamics of cellular decision-making.
     Until we can uncover developmental programs at the single cell level in
     living embryos, there is no telli  ng what insights have been hidden from our
     view.<br/><br/>
     In our lab, we develop new experimental and computational tools to
     measure and manipulate the flow of information along the central dogma
     in single cells of living, developing embryos using the fruit fly
     <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> as a case study.

        Slowly maturing fluorescent fusions are insufficient to reveal
        transcription factor concentration dynamics in development. To
        circumvent this challenge, we have developed the LlamaTag technology,
        a technique for rapid fluorescent labeling of newly expressed
        proteins that allows for single-cell, live imaging of protein
        expression at high spatiotemporal resolution.

        Writing theoretical models of endogenous regulatory regions in
        development calls for governing equations with too many unknown
        parameters. As an alternative approach to modeling endogenous
        complexity, we have developed several synthetic enhancer systems that
        attempt to build eukaryotic transcription from the ground up. The
        ensuing models are much more tractable, making it possible to engage
        in a dialogue between theory and experiment to test our theoretical
        predictions.

        accessibility regulation both in and out of thermodynamic
        equilibrium.

      desc: > 
        Transcriptional bursting seems to be more the rule than the exception
        throughout biology. Yet, while we have uncovered which bursting
        parameters (frequency, duration, and amplitude) are controlled by
        transcription factors, we remain ignorant about how this control is
        implemented at the molecular level. With our ability to characterize
        both transcription factor input and transcriptional output dynamics
        at the single cell level, we are developing new analysis methods to
        reveal the Anatomy of a Burst: the precise ordering of biochemical
        events that occur prior, during, and after a burst, at individual
        promoters in living embryos with the time resolution of a few
        seconds.
