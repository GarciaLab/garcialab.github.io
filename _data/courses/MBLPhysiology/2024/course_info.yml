  In our time together in the theory module of skills week, we’ll take a tour
  through the worlds of numerical thinking in biology and simple physical models of
  biological systems. We’ll try our hand at order-of-magnitude estimates and pen-and-paper
  models of phenomena like biological growth, diffusion, phase separation, polymerization,
  and more! For some topics, we’ll complement our calculations with Python simulations.
  You’ll also prepare and present an order-of-magnitude (‘Fermi’) estimate related to
  your own interests or research. Our main goal is to explore together how powerful
  (and fun!) numerical and physical thinking can be as a tool in understanding biology.

#structure: >
#  The class as a whole will meet twice a week for one hour and a half: 
#  Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2pm-3:30pm in 251 Dwinelle. This
#  time will be devoted to lectures, discussions and hands-on activities
#  including Python exercises. Further, the class will be split into weekly
#  one-hour lab sessions. During these lab sessions, students will work
#  closely with the GSIs to implement the concepts they learned in class in
#  the context of different biological problems. Homework assignment will be
#  given every week and will represent 70% of the final grade. At the end of
#  the semester, students will prepare a written project. The project
#  will be based  on performing an estimate based on an extensive list we
#  will provide.

#  <b>Attending class and office hours</b><br/>
#  If you miss classes, it is your responsibility to get notes from one of your
#  classmates. You cannot expect the instructor or GSI to redo the lecture
#  during office hours.
#  <br/>
#  Being able to attend office hours are a key to success. If you cannot attend
#  any of the three offered office hours, you might want to reconsider taking
#  this course.
#  <br/><br/>
#  <b>Homework assignments</b><br/>
#  Homeworks are due at the beginning of class one week after they are posted.
#  <br/>
#  Homeworks should be submitted through <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/700676">Gradescope</a>
#  to the GSIs in PDF form. Any other form of homework submission will not be accepted. No late
#  homeworks. Time management is key. Start to work on your homework assignments
#  early and make use of office hours and our availability over <a href="https://piazza.com/class/lr0plqdj7uv5q">Piazza</a>.
#  <br/>
#  It is important to describe your reasoning. Just writing an equation or
#  drawing a plot does not constitute a satisfactory answer to a homework
#  problem. All plots in the homeworks need to have labeled axes. All code used
#  needs to be submitted through GraceScope by the homework due date. You can
#  work in groups, but the answers should be your own. This includes the code!
#  <br/>
#  <br/>
#  <b>Grading</b><br/>
#  Regrading is done only until a week after the homework solutions are
#  posted. If you ask us to regrade an answer in a homework assignment, we
#  reserve the right to regrade all the answers it that homework assignment.
#  Your two worst scoring homeworks will not be considered for the final
#  grade. We do not grade on a curve or anything like that.
