  Biology is being revolutionized by new experimental techniques that have
  made it possible to quantitatively query the inner workings of molecules,
  cells and multicellular organisms in ways that were previously
  unimaginable. The objective of this course is to respond to this deluge of
  quantitative data through quantitative models and the use of biological
  numeracy. The course will explore the description of a broad array of
  topics from modern biology using the language of physics and mathematics.
  One style of thinking we will emphasize imagines the kinds of simple
  calculations that one can do with a stick in the sand.

  <br/><br/>
  We will draw examples from broad swaths of modern biology from our
  department and beyond including cell biology (signaling and regulation,
  cell motility), physiology (metabolism, swimming), developmental biology
  (patterning of body plans, how size and number of organelles and tissues
  are controlled), neuroscience (action potentials and ion channel gating)
  and evolution (population genetics) in order to develop theoretical models
  that make precise predictions about biological phenomena. These predictions
  will be tested through the hands-on analysis of experimental data and by
  performing numerical simulations using Python. Physical biology will be
  introduced as an exciting new tool to complement other approaches within
  biology such as genetics, genomics and structural biology. The course will
  introduce students to the enabling power of biological numeracy in
  scientific discovery and make it possible for them to use these tools in
  their own future research.

structure: >
  The class as a whole will meet twice a week for one hour and a half -
  Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11am - 12:30pm. The first few lectures will
  be on Zoom at the address linked in the Syllabus section below, and
  in 219 Dwinelle once in-person classes resume. This
  time will be devoted to lectures, discussions and hands-on activities
  including Python exercises. Further, the class will be split into weekly
  one-hour lab sessions. During these lab sessions, students will work
  closely with the GSIs to implement the concepts they learned in class in
  the context of different biological problems. Homework assignment will be
  given every week and will represent 75% of the final grade. Twice during
  the semester, students will prepare a project. The first project will be a
  written assignment, while the second project will be presented in class.
  These projects will represent 25% of the final grade.
  <br/><br/>
  For undergraduate students (MCB137L), the projects will consist on carrying
  out an estimate on a biological phenomenon of interest following the style
  presented in class. These presentations will be five minutes long.
  <br/><br/>
  For graduate students (MCB237L) the project will consist on presenting a
  theoretical model developed in a recent paper of their choosing to the
  class. These presentations will be ten minutes long.

policies: > 
  <b>Attending class and office hours</b><br/>
  If you miss classes, it is your responsibility to get notes from one of your
  classmates. You cannot expect the instructor or GSI to redo the lecture
  during office hours.
  <br/>
  Being able to attend office hours are a key to success. If you cannot attend
  any of the three offered office hours, you might want to reconsider taking
  this course.
  <br/><br/>
  <b>Homework assignments</b><br/>
  Homeworks are due at the beginning of class one week after they are posted.
  <br/>
  Homeworks should be submitted through <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/340644">Gradescope</a>
  to the GSIs in PDF form. Any other form of homework submission will not be accepted. No late
  homeworks. Time management is key. Start to work on your homework assignments
  early and make use of office hours and our availability over <a href="https://piazza.com/class/kx7v9ujrmff7cy">Piazza</a>.
  <br/>
  It is important to describe your reasoning. Just writing an equation or
  drawing a plot does not constitute a satisfactory answer to a homework
  problem. All plots in the homeworks need to have labeled axes. All code used
  needs to be submitted through GraceScope by the homework due date. You can
  work in groups, but the answers should be your own. This includes the code!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>Grading</b><br/>
  Regrading is done only until a week after the homework solutions are
  posted. If you ask us to regrade an answer in a homework assignment, we
  reserve the right to regrade all the answers it that homework assignment.
  Your two worst scoring homeworks will not be considered for the final
  grade. We do not grade on a curve(distribution) or anything like that.
