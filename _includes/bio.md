Over the last few decades, impressive progress has been made in uncovering
how embryonic development is driven by genes connected in complex regulatory
networks. Our research goal is to endow these networks with quantitative and
molecular information that makes it possible to precisely predict how the
gene expression patterns that dictate cellular identity are prescribed by
input activators and repressors, and the arrangement of binding sites for
these transcription factors on the DNA. We test our models by systematically
varying DNA regulatory architecture and by inventing new technology to
perform precision measurements of the flow of information along the central
dogma.
