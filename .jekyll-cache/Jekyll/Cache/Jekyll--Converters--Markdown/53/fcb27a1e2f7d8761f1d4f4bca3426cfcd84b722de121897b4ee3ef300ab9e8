<h3 class="banner"> About </h3>
Biology is being revolutionized by new experimental techniques that have made it possible to quantitatively query the inner workings of molecules, cells and multicellular organisms in ways that were previously unimaginable. The objective of this course is to respond to this deluge of quantitative data through quantitative models and the use of biological numeracy. The course will explore the description of a broad array of topics from modern biology using the language of physics and mathematics. One style of thinking we will emphasize imagines the kinds of simple calculations that one can do with a stick in the sand.
<br /><br /> We will draw examples from broad swaths of modern biology from our department and beyond including cell biology (signaling and regulation, cell motility), physiology (metabolism, swimming), developmental biology (patterning of body plans, how size and number of organelles and tissues are controlled), neuroscience (action potentials and ion channel gating) and evolution (population genetics) in order to develop theoretical models that make precise predictions about biological phenomena. These predictions will be tested through the hands-on analysis of experimental data and by performing numerical simulations using Python. Physical biology will be introduced as an exciting new tool to complement other approaches within biology such as genetics, genomics and structural biology. The course will introduce students to the enabling power of biological numeracy in scientific discovery and make it possible for them to use these tools in their own future research.

<h3 class="banner"> Course Structure </h3>
The class as a whole will meet twice a week for one hour and a half. This time will be devoted to lectures, discussions and hands-on activities including Python exercises. Further, the class will be split into weekly one-hour lab sessions. During these lab sessions, students will work closely with the GSIs to implement the concepts they learned in class in the context of different biological problems. Homework assignment will be given every week and will represent 75% of the final grade. Twice during the semester, students will prepare a project. The first project will be a written assignment, while the second project will be presented in class. These projects will represent 25% of the final grade. <br /><br /> For undergraduate students (MCB137L), the projects will consist on carrying out an estimate on a biological phenomenon of interest following the style presented in class. These presentations will be five minutes long. <br /><br /> For graduate students (MCB237L) the project will consist on presenting a theoretical model developed in a recent paper of their choosing to the class. These presentations will be ten minutes long.
